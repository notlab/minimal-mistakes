The rational projective determinant is a canonically defined function \\(\mathrm{Pdet} : \mathrm{Mat}(n;\mathbb{Q}) \to \mathbb{Z}\\)
introduced by [John F. R. Duncan](https://sites.google.com/site/johnfrduncan/home) in his paper [Arithmetic Groups and the Affine E8
Dynkin Diagram](https://arxiv.org/abs/0810.1465). In this note we define the rational projective determinant and investigate some of
its elementary properties.
