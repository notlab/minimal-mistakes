In the article [Introduction to Delay Differential Equations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-01-22-delay-differential-equations %})
we introduced a simple algorithm for solving delay equations of the form
<div class="mathjax">\begin{equation*} 
  \frac{\mathrm{d}x}{\mathrm{d}t} = f(t, x(t), x(t - \tau))
\end{equation*}</div>
