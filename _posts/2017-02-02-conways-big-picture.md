### Background

In what follows we always assume \\(\omega_1, \omega_2 \in \mathbb{C}\\) are linearly indepenent over \\(\mathbb{R}\\). 

**Definition 1.** The \\(\mathbb{Z}\\)-module \\(\langle \omega_1, \omega_2\rangle\\) defined by
<div class="mathjax">\begin{equation*}
  \langle \omega_1, \omega_2 \rangle = \mathbb{Z}\omega_1 \oplus \mathbb{Z}\omega_2
\end{equation*}</div>
is called the *lattice* (in \\(\mathbb{C}\\)) generated by \\(\omega_1, \omega_2\\). We shall write \\(\mathrm{Lat}(\mathbb{C})\\) to denote 
the set of all lattices in \\(\mathbb{C}\\). 
∎

The set of all lattices in \\(\mathbb{C}\\) is slightly too large for us to say anything useful about here. To make things more managable
we will consider two lattices to be equivalent if one is a rational multiple of the other. More precisely:

**Definition 2.**
Let us write \\(L_1 \sim L_2\\) if \\(L_1, L_2\\) are two lattices satisfying
<div class="mathjax">\begin{equation*}
  L_1 = \langle \omega_1, \omega_2 \rangle = \langle \lambda \omega_1 \lambda \omega_2 \rangle = L_2
\end{equation*}</div>
for some \\(\lambda \in \mathbb{Q}^\times\\). It is easy to see that \\(\sim\\) is an equivalence relation on \\(\mathrm{Lat}(\mathbb{C})\\).
If \\(L_1 \sim L_2\\) we say \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2\\) are *projectively equivalent*. Equivalence classes under \\(\sim\\) are also called 
*projective classes*.
∎

**Definition 3.**
We say that two lattices are *commensurable* if the subgroup \\(L_1 \cap L_2\\) has finite index in both \\(L_1\\) and \\(L_2\\). Two 
projective classes of lattices are commensurable if we can choose commensurable representative elements.
∎

Notice that a lattice in \\(\mathbb{C}\\) is the same thing as a discrete additive subgroup of \\(\mathbb{C}\\). 

### Lattice Normal Form

Let \\(e_1 = 1\\) and \\(e_2 = i\\) be the standard basis vectors for \\(\mathbb{C}\\) as an \\(\mathbb{R}\\)-vector space. The lattice
\\(\langle e_1, e_2\rangle\\) is called the *standard lattice*. In this section we show that any projective class of lattice commensurable to 
\\(\langle e_1, e_2\rangle\\) has a representative of the form \\(\langle M e_1 + \frac{m}{g} e_2, e_2\rangle\\). 

To this end, let us first observe that any lattice commensurable with \\(\langle e_1, e_2\rangle\\) can be written in the form
<div class="mathjax">\begin{equation} \label{eq:fracs}
 \left\langle \frac{a_0}{a_1} e_1 + \frac{b_0}{b_1} e_2, \frac{c_0}{c_1} e_1, \frac{d_0}{d_1} e_2 \right\rangle
\end{equation}</div>
where each of the coefficients on the \\(e_i\\) are elements of \\(\mathbb{Q}\\) in lowest terms. Clearing denominators in equation 
\ref{eq:fracs} yields a projectively equivalent lattice
<div class="mathjax">\begin{equation} \label{eq:ints}
  \langle Ae_1 + Be_2 , Ce_1 + De_2 \rangle
\end{equation}</div>
where \\(A, B, C, D \in \mathbb{Z}\\). Next, if we choose a matrix 
\\(\left(\begin{smallmatrix}\alpha & \beta \\\\ \gamma & \delta\end{smallmatrix}\right) \in \mathrm{SL}(2;\mathbb{Z})\\) then the lattice
<div class="mathjax">\begin{align} \label{eq:big} \begin{split}
  \langle \alpha(A & e_1 + Be_2) + \beta(Ce_1 + De_2), \gamma(Ae_1 + Be_2) + \delta(Ce_1 + De_2)\rangle
\end{split} \end{align}</div>
is the same as the lattice in equation \ref{eq:ints}. If this expression is to reduce to something of the form
\\(\langle Me_1 + \frac{m}{g} e_2, e_2\rangle\\), it is necessary that \\(\gamma A + \delta C = 0\\)
